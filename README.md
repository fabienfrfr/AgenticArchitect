# AgenticArchitect

**AgenticArchitect** (or **TheArchitect**) is a local-first multi-agent system designed to transform raw client specifications into production-ready AI and Data solutions.

By leveraging **Stateful Graph Orchestration (LangGraph)** and high-performance local LLMs (like **NVIDIA Nemotron-3**), it automates the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) from requirements analysis to SOLID code generation.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture (The Swimlane)

The system follows a strict automated workflow based on an agentic bus:

1. **Project Manager Agent**: Validates SMART requirements and identifies gaps.
2. **Data Analyst Agent**: Performs EDA and synthetic data generation.
3. **Architect Agent**: Designs C4 Diagrams and Decision Records (ADR).
4. **Engineer Agent**: Produces TDD-backed, SOLID-compliant code.
